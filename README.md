# Ethereum-Stealer
Generate random ethereum wallets &amp; private keys and then check if they match a wallet that contains some kind of balance, so that you can take it. In Node.js

# REQUIREMENTS
1. Install Node.js
2. npm install
3. Lots of time on your hands.. there's a lot and I mean A LOT of possible addresses and keys, you will be extremely lucky to find any that will match your riches.txt list.

# HOW TO RUN
Just start run.bat (or run.sh if you're on linux).

# SPEED / PERFORMANCE
Very slow at the moment (haven't checked the actual speed yet). I literally just made it, will be updated when I get the time and care enough.. this is just an idea for now but still is going to work if you have extreme luck and find a wallet quickly lol.

# TEST IT
Go to the test folder and hit run. It will show you what would happen if a wallet from your list was found.

# WHY DO THIS?
Just like with bitcoin, there are some ethereum wallets with high balances that are lost forever, which means nobody can access them and the money is basically there just to be picked up by anyone. This program can possibly find these lost wallets and their matching private keys & 12 words and take the eth out of them.

# WANT TO THANK ME?
If you would like to tip me in case you won anything or you appreciate the program, here is my BTC wallet and ETH. It will be greatly appreciated. Also you can give this project a star :)

# NOTE
I'm not actually responsible for what you do with this. Don't steal active wallet money, that's just wrong. Not to mention the new wallets are most likely protected much more with extra password and stuff.

# Also Note
It's almost impossible to find anything. The chances of winning are extremely low. You could get lucky though, good luck!

# Why would this even be possible?
Because most used apps for ethereum use only one main Derivation Path (to my surprise) and don't even use extra passwords or anything for new wallets (to my surprise aswel!)
